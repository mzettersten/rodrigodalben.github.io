In this ongoing project we explore whether early preference for Infant Directed Speech (IDS) is linked to later vocabulary size. <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/placeholder.png"> For instance, we are interested in investigating to what extent preference for IDS predicts infants' vocabulary; if the relation between IDS preference and vocabulary size changes over development; and if there is any systematic differences in the strength of this relationship across the language communities. Infantsâ€™ preference for IDS was tested as part of the MabyBabies1 project, and follow-up CDI data is being collected from a subsample of this dataset at 18 and 24 months of age.
