UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This project investigate infants' theory of mind. We ask if infants show anticipatory looking that reflects the false belief of another agent.

We employ a design of removal and location-change.

The research group is composed of a large consortium of ToM researchers and labs, including original authors of all original studies, as well researchers from all theoretical orientations (spanning, for example, nativist and core knowledge, dual process, conceptual change and skepticsâ€¦)"
