**ManyBabies** is a collaborative project for replication and best practices in developmental psychology research. Our goal is to bring researchers together to address difficult outstanding theoretical and methodological questions about the nature of early development and how it is studied. For example:

<!--- Do infants prefer agents who are seen to help over those who are seen to hinder?-->
- Infants prefer helpers or hinders?
<!--- What factors shape infants’ preferences for familiar and novel stimuli? -->
- Infants prefer novel or familiar stimuli?
<!--How does Infant Direct Speech preference vary across age?-->
- Is Infant Direct Speech is more appealing to infants than Adult Directed Speech?

<!--- Do infants show anticipatory looking that reflects the false belief of another agent?-->
