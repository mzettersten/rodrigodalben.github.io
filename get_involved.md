**ManyBabies** encourage everyone (from undergrads to senior researchers) who is interested in developmental research to get involved! Please note that access to infants/infant lab is **not** a prerequisite.

There are several ways to get involved and contribute to **MB** projects. As you can imagine, planning and executing a **MB** project involves a lot of work and a infinitude of tasks. Generally, tasks are divided into three groups:

1. *Planning and writing*: Ideally, all steps and procedures (from literature review to data analysis) are defined before the start of data collection for any **MB** study. This is done in a collaborative fashion and is usually formalized in a [pre-registration](https://www.cos.io/prereg) archived in a public repository or in a [registred-report](https://www.cos.io/rr) submitted to peer-review analysis and also archived in a public repository.

2. *Creating analyses, materials, and methods*: Replicating the same experiment across the globe means that traditional methods, materials, and analyses will need to be adapated and, sometimes, new ones will need to be created (e.g., [MB-AtHome]({{site.baseurl}}/MB-athome/)).

3. *Data collection*: Needless to say that data is essential for any **MB** project. Collecting data following standard protocols usually require adaptation on the every-day routine of a lab and staff training.

Given **MB** collaborative nature, there is room for getting involved on any of these tasks and authorship is granted to anyone who had a sustained intellectual contribution on any of these tasks. Learn more about [authorship here]({{site.baseurl}}/authorship/).
