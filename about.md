To do:
- update funding information? MB2 Grant?
- map (with governing board members)
  - psa uses flourish: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1103427/
      - disavantages = 1. manual update, 2. points with the same coordinates overlap.
  - address and latitude/long being recovered automatically with google sheets (geom add-on)
  - make R version? tmap seems to be the way.

Information to come from registration/sign up:
- Number of collaborators and where they come from
- contributors MAP (data from registrations)

The **ManyBabies** project was born comitted to Open Science and with the desire to employ the best research practices to test hypotheses about infant development that individual labs could perhaps never adequately test. Infant research usually requires significant human and financial resources and is slow to conduct. These aspects, combined with the pressure to publish at a rapid pace to secure promotions and funding, can render the conduction of large-scale projects unpractical under individual labs contexts.

On the other hand, large-scale *collaborative* and *Open Science* projects have the potential to test complex hypothesis and avoid the consequences of low statistical power [(Button et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3475) and the dramatic inflation of false positives caused by “questionable research practices” [(Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632). Inspired by [Klein et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000178) ManyLabs' first study, in which a group of independent labs all ran the same set of replication protocols and pooled their data, an e-mail thread began, which eventually led to a [blog post](https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-manybabies-project.html), and to the formation of the consortium of infancy labs.

**ManyBabies** collaborative nature implies that all aspects of a given project (e.g., research question, study design, stimulus creation, piloting, data collection, analysis, interpretation of the findings, and writing) are decided on a consensus-based approach. By doing so, **MB** aims to promote community-building in infancy research outside of the standard framework; especially by creating an environment of trust and equality that can engage researchers/labs from a broad spectrum of backgrounds. To learn more about the **MB** vision for the role of large-scale collaborations in the field, check [Frank et al. (2017)](https://psyarxiv.com/27b43/) and [Byers-Heinlein et al. (in press)](https://psyarxiv.com/dmhk2/).

### Definitions and Roles

**ManyBabies** activities are guided by the principles of:
* *Transparency*: All decisions in a ManyBabies project, from design to publication, are as transparent as possible;
* *Collective governance*: When possible and feasible, decisions are made jointly and transparently;
* *Inclusivity and diversity*: **MB** explicitly encourages efforts to increase diversity. This includes active applications for funding to assist laboratories from under-represented communities to participate, outreach efforts, and planning workshops;
* *Ethical research*: **MB** projects are committed to best practices and high ethical standards;
* *Respect*: Everyone agrees to a general code of conduct which ensures respectful interactions.

Learn more about our [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYSevbWnBQwd_eaBe1oKkOBX-8sMsBfiPz2kwNp7Ttc/export?format=pdf).
Note that this is a living document. Comments and questions are explicitly encouraged. [Here is a version of the document that allows (anonymous) comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYSevbWnBQwd_eaBe1oKkOBX-8sMsBfiPz2kwNp7Ttc/edit).

**ManyBabies** [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) aim to test hypotheses about:
* *Validity*: Assess the replicability, generalizability, and robustness of key findings in infancy (effect + effect size + moderators) in consensus paradigms. Note that these paradigms are not necessarily exact replications of seminal studies;
* *Theory*: Understand infant development across a wide range of ages and experiences (e.g., language and cultural background);
* *Methods*: Quantify sources of variability across labs and establish best practices;
* *Diversity*: Increase diversity of participants, researchers, & research questions.

<!-- data from code of conduct -->
**ManyBabies** collaborators come from 6-continent, 30+ nations. They can serve as:
* *Governing board members*: The ManyBabies Governing Board is the group of individuals responsible for governance decisions in the ManyBabies project, including decisions about funding, new projects, and other project-wide concerns.
* *Project Leads*: a group or a single person that coordinates all aspects of a study (e.g., setting up work groups, guidelines) and that ensures that all aspects adhere to the **MB** code of conduct;
* *Data Contributors*: collect data following the experimental protocol as provided by the project lead;
* *Project Contributors*: create stimuli, specify protocols, contribute analysis code, and any other relevant task defined by the project lead.
