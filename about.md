To do:
- update funding information? MB2 Grant?
- map (with governing board members)
  - psa uses flourish: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1103427/
      - disavantages = 1. manual update, 2. points with the same coordinates overlap.
  - address and latitude/long being recovered automatically with google sheets (geom add-on)
  - make R version? tmap seems to be the way.

Information to come from registration/sign up:
- Number of collaborators and where they come from
- contributors MAP (data from registrations)

The **ManyBabies** project was [born](https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-manybabies-project.html) comitted to Open Science and to the best research practices to test hypotheses about infant development that individual labs could perhaps never adequately test. **MB** collaborative nature implies that all project decisions (e.g., research question, study design, stimulus creation, piloting, data collection, analysis, interpretation of the findings, and writing) are made on a consensus-based approach. We strive for an environment of trust and equality that can engage researchers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds. Learn more about **MB** vision for the role of large-scale collaborations, check [Frank et al. (2017)](https://psyarxiv.com/27b43/) and [Byers-Heinlein et al. (in press)](https://psyarxiv.com/dmhk2/).

<!-- Too detailed?
Infant research usually requires significant human and financial resources and is slow to conduct. These aspects, combined with the pressure to publish at a rapid pace to secure promotions and funding, can render the conduction of large-scale projects unpractical under individual labs contexts.

Too historical?
On the other hand, large-scale *collaborative* and *Open Science* projects have the potential to test complex hypothesis and avoid the consequences of low statistical power [(Button et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3475) and the dramatic inflation of false positives caused by “questionable research practices” [(Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632). Inspired by [Klein et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000178) ManyLabs' first study, in which a group of independent labs all ran the same set of replication protocols and pooled their data, an e-mail thread began, which eventually led to a [blog post](https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-manybabies-project.html), and to the formation of the consortium of infancy labs.

### Definitions and Roles
**ManyBabies** activities are guided by the principles of:
* *Transparency*: All decisions in a **MB** project, from design to publication, are as transparent as possible;
* *Collective governance*: When possible and feasible, decisions are made jointly and transparently;
* *Inclusivity and diversity*: **MB** explicitly encourages efforts to increase diversity. This includes active applications for funding to assist laboratories from under-represented communities to participate, outreach efforts, and planning workshops;
* *Ethical research*: **MB** projects are committed to best practices and high ethical standards;
* *Respect*: Everyone agrees to a general code of conduct which ensures respectful interactions.

Check our [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYSevbWnBQwd_eaBe1oKkOBX-8sMsBfiPz2kwNp7Ttc/export?format=pdf).
Note that this is a living document. Comments and questions are explicitly encouraged. [Here is a version of the document that allows (anonymous) comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYSevbWnBQwd_eaBe1oKkOBX-8sMsBfiPz2kwNp7Ttc/edit).

**ManyBabies** [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) aim to test hypotheses about:
* *Validity*: Assess the replicability, generalizability, and robustness of key findings in infancy (effect + effect size + moderators) in consensus paradigms. Note that these paradigms are not necessarily exact replications of seminal studies;
* *Theory*: Understand infant development across a wide range of ages and experiences (e.g., language and cultural background);
* *Methods*: Quantify sources of variability across labs and establish best practices;
* *Diversity*: Increase diversity of participants, researchers, & research questions.

<!-- data from code of conduct -->
**ManyBabies** collaborators come from 6-continent, 30+ nations. They can serve as:
* *Governing board members*: Responsible for governance decisions, including decisions about funding, new projects, and other project-wide concerns.
* *Project Leads*: Coordinates all aspects of a study (e.g., setting up work groups, guidelines) and ensures that all aspects adhere to the **MB** code of conduct;
* *Data Contributors*: Collect data following an experimental protocol;
* *Project Contributors*: Create stimuli, protocols, analysis code, and any other relevant tasks.

Check the detailed description of [roles and responsabilities of each collaborator type](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYSevbWnBQwd_eaBe1oKkOBX-8sMsBfiPz2kwNp7Ttc/export?format=pdf), [authorship guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/authorship/) and [get involved]({{site.baseurl}}/get_involved/).
