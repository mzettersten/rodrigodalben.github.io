In this ongoing project we investigate an ability that lies at the heart of cognition: to learn and to apply rules. We ask whether infants (from 5 to 12 months-old) can learn abstract algebraic rules over syllable sequences and generalize those rules to novel syllable sequences. <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/placeholder.png"> Despite the large research effort on the topic, questions remain about the robustness of the core finding, as many studies failed to find significant learning effects. We believe that a multi-lab approach with a large and diverse sample of infants have the potential to uncover whether and to what extent this core cognitive ability is available in young infants and how it varies across different developmental circumstances.
