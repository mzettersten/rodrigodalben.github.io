Familiarity and novelty effects are the cornerstone of many infant behavioral methods (e.g., habituation, head-turn preference, preferential looking / looking-while-listening, eye tracking). <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/placeholder.png"> In this project we investigate [Hunter and Ames’ (1988)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-98065-003) model of infants’ preference for familiar and novel stimuli. We aim to empirically test whether infant age, task difficulty, and familiarization time interact to predict the direction of infants’ preference for familiar vs. novel objects.
