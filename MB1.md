<!-- Description (300-word?) intro + method + result -->
This is the first **ManyBabies** project. It replicates a finding reported by the developmental literature that is believed to be robust: infantsâ€™ preference for infant-directed speech (IDS) over adult-directed speech (ADS).

Infant-directed speech is usually higher pitched, has greater pitch excursions, and shorter utterances when compared to adult-directed speech. We asked if infants have a preference for infant-directed speech, and how this preference varies across age, method, and native language background.

Sixty-seven labs and 149 individual contributors collaborated on the study. By focusing on a single phenomenon across labs, we were able to assess its overall replicability and investigate the factors moderating it.

This is the first **ManyBabies** project, seeking to replicate the classic infant-directed speech preference shown by infants. We asked if infants have a preference for infant-directed speech? How does this preference vary across age, method, and native language background?
