All infants from MB1, regardless of their linguistic background, heard stimuli recorded in North American English. <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/placeholder.png"> In this ongoing project we ask how does Infant Directed Speech (IDS) preference to North American English in MB1 compare to IDS preference measured in non-English speaking babies’ native language. Infants whose primary exposure language is either French, Dutch, Norwegian, Czech, or Turkish will be tested in their respective native language using the same procedure from MB1.
